# Feel Veg


## Overview 📖
**Feel Veg** is a single page app based on vegetarian recipes.

The app is structured in two main sections:

* Main section where the app displays random recipes without searching a food.

* Info section where you can find benefits and risks about veg diet( datas have been takne from an Harvard case study).


Searching for a food the app will redirect you to results page where it displays  cards with all best recipes containing that specific food.

Each card contains details about that recipe, including info about glutenFree and vegan diet.


At the bottom of the page you'll find the footer with 3 buttons/icons:

* Home will redirect you to home page.

* Paper airplane will redirect you to my personal website.

* Info icon will explain you what icons (vegan, vegetarian and glutenFree) mean.



## Features 📝

The app has been created with React.

I implemented:

* **React Router** for the paths, that allowed me to keep the status of a SAP.
* **React Icons** for the icons.
* **Axios** to optimize Api requests.
* **React Hooks** as UseState, UseEffect, UseNavigate to manage the state and perform a better app.


Conditional rendering has been used to display the info section at the bottom.
